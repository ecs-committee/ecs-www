				<span className="c0">
					The Entertainment Collaboration Structure (ECS) is a comprehensive tool designed to help you
					structure your drawing in a simple and easy to understand manner. It is not designed to be a
					complete manual with every single item and aspect of a drawing defined, rather we aim to give you
					the building blocks needed and for you to expand upon when the project calls for specific solutions
					that are not defined in this structure.

			<p className="c1 c5">
				<span className="c0"></span>

			<p className="c1">
				<span className="c0">
					The project started as a tool to simplify the process of migrating data from one drawing software to
					another, centered around the needs of the lighting, sound, video and rigging departments in the live
					entertainment sector. The goal was to move items, symbols and objects from one file to another
					without losing track of where and to whom they belonged in the drawing. This has evolved into a more
					comprehensive tool for organizing the entirety of the drawing, including the broader spectrum of
					disciplines usually associated with live events and television productions. &nbsp;
